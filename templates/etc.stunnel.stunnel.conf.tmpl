; Sample stunnel configuration file by Michal Trojnara 2002-2009
; Some options used here may not be adequate for your particular configuration
; Please make sure you understand them (especially the effect of the chroot j$
; Certificate/key is needed in server mode and optional in client mode
cert = <InstallDir>/ssl/mysb.cert
key = <InstallDir>/ssl/mysb.key

; Protocol version (all, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1)
sslVersion = all
options = NO_SSLv2
options = NO_SSLv3

; Some security enhancements for UNIX systems - comment them out on Win32
chroot = /var/lib/stunnel4/
setuid = stunnel4

; PID is created inside the chroot jail
pid = /stunnel4.pid

; Some performance tunings
socket = l:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = r:TCP_NODELAY=1
socket = a:SO_BINDTODEVICE=lo

;options = DONT_INSERT_EMPTY_FRAGMENTS

; Authentication stuff
;verify = 2

; Don't forget to c_rehash CApath
; CApath is located inside chroot jail
;CApath = /certs

; It's often easier to use CAfile
CAfile = <InstallDir>/ssl/CA/certs/cacert.pem

; Don't forget to c_rehash CRLpath
; CRLpath is located inside chroot jail
;CRLpath = /crls

; Alternatively you can use CRLfile
;CRLfile = /etc/stunnel/crls.pem

; Some debugging stuff useful for troubleshooting
