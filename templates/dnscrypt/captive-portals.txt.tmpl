## Some operating systems send queries to these names after a network change,
## in order to check if connectivity beyond the router is possible without
## going through a captive portal.
##
## This is a list of hard-coded IP addresses that will be returned when queries
## for these names are received, even before the operating system an interface
## as usable for reaching the Internet.
##
## Note that IPv6 addresses don't need to be specified within brackets,
## as there are no port numbers.
