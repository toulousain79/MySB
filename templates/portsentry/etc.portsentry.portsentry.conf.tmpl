# Port Configurations #
#######################
#
#
# Some example port configs for classic and basic Stealth modes
#
# I like to always keep some ports at the "low" end of the spectrum.
# This will detect a sequential port sweep really quickly and usually
# these ports are not in use (i.e. tcpmux port 1)
#
# ** X-Windows Users **: If you are running X on your box, you need to be sure
# you are not binding PortSentry to port 6000 (or port 2000 for OpenWindows users).
# Doing so will prevent the X-client from starting properly.
#
# These port bindings are *ignored* for Advanced Stealth Scan Detection Mode.
#

# Un-comment these if you are really anal:
#TCP_PORTS="1,7,9,11,15,70,79,80,109,110,111,119,138,139,143,512,513,514,515,540,635,1080,1524,2000,2001,4000,4001,5742,6000,6001,6667,12345,12346,20034,27665,30303,32771,32772,32773,32774,31337,40421,40425,49724,54320"

# This is the number of ports you want PortSentry to monitor in Advanced mode.
# Any port *below* this number will be monitored. Right now it watches
# everything below 1024.
#
# On many Linux systems you cannot bind above port 61000. This is because
# these ports are used as part of IP masquerading. I don't recommend you
# bind over this number of ports. Realistically: I DON'T RECOMMEND YOU MONITOR
# OVER 1024 PORTS AS YOUR FALSE ALARM RATE WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY RISE. You've been
# warned! Don't write me if you have have a problem because I'll only tell
# you to RTFM and don't run above the first 1024 ports.
#
#
ADVANCED_PORTS_TCP="1024"
ADVANCED_PORTS_UDP="1024"
#
# This field tells PortSentry what ports (besides listening daemons) to
# ignore. This is helpful for services like ident that services such
# as FTP, SMTP, and wrappers look for but you may not run (and probably
# *shouldn't* IMHO).
#
# By specifying ports here PortSentry will simply not respond to
# incoming requests, in effect PortSentry treats them as if they are
# actual bound daemons. The default ports are ones reported as
# problematic false alarms and should probably be left alone for
# all but the most isolated systems/networks.
#
# Default TCP ident and NetBIOS service
ADVANCED_EXCLUDE_TCP="113,139"
# Default UDP route (RIP), NetBIOS, bootp broadcasts.
ADVANCED_EXCLUDE_UDP="520,138,137,67"

# Misc. Configuration Options#
##############################
#
# DNS Name resolution - Setting this to "1" will turn on DNS lookups

# it off.
RESOLVE_HOST = "1"

###################
# Response Options#
###################
# Options to dispose of attacker. Each is an action that will
# be run if an attack is detected. If you don't want a particular
# option then comment it out and it will be skipped.
#
# The variable $TARGET$ will be substituted with the target attacking
# host when an attack is detected. The variable $PORT$ will be substituted
# with the port that was scanned.
#
##################
# Ignore Options #
##################
# These options allow you to enable automatic response
# options for UDP/TCP. This is useful if you just want
# warnings for connections, but don't want to react for
# a particular protocol (i.e. you want to block TCP, but
# not UDP). To prevent a possible Denial of service attack
# against UDP and stealth scan detection for TCP, you may
# want to disable blocking, but leave the warning enabled.
# I personally would wait for this to become a problem before
# doing though as most attackers really aren't doing this.
# The third option allows you to run just the external command
# in case of a scan to have a pager script or such execute
# but not drop the route. This may be useful for some admins
# who want to block TCP, but only want pager/e-mail warnings
# on UDP, etc.
#
#
# 0 = Do not block UDP/TCP scans.
# 1 = Block UDP/TCP scans.
# 2 = Run external command only (KILL_RUN_CMD)

BLOCK_UDP="1"

###################
# Dropping Routes:#
###################
# This command is used to drop the route or add the host into
# a local filter table.
#
# The gateway (333.444.555.666) should ideally be a dead host on
# the *local* subnet. On some hosts you can also point this at
# localhost (127.0.0.1) and get the same effect. NOTE THAT
# 333.444.555.66 WILL *NOT* WORK. YOU NEED TO CHANGE IT!!
#
# ALL KILL ROUTE OPTIONS ARE COMMENTED OUT INITIALLY. Make sure you
# uncomment the correct line for your OS. If you OS is not listed
# here and you have a route drop command that works then please
# mail it to me so I can include it. ONLY ONE KILL_ROUTE OPTION
# CAN BE USED AT A TIME SO DON'T UNCOMMENT MULTIPLE LINES.
#
# NOTE: The route commands are the least optimal way of blocking
# and do not provide complete protection against UDP attacks and
# will still generate alarms for both UDP and stealth scans. I
# always recommend you use a packet filter because they are made
# for this purpose.
#

# Generic
#KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/route add $TARGET$ 333.444.555.666"

# Generic Linux
#KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/route add -host $TARGET$ gw 333.444.555.666"

# Newer versions of Linux support the reject flag now. This
# is cleaner than the above option.

# Generic BSD (BSDI, OpenBSD, NetBSD, FreeBSD)
#KILL_ROUTE="/sbin/route add $TARGET$ 333.444.555.666"

# Using a packet filter is the PREFERRED. The below lines
# work well on many OS's. Remember, you can only uncomment *one*
# KILL_ROUTE option.

# For those of you running FreeBSD (and compatible) you can
# use their built in firewalling as well.

###############
# TCP Wrappers#
###############
# This text will be dropped into the hosts.deny file for wrappers
# to use. There are two formats for TCP wrappers:
#
# Format One: Old Style - The default when extended host processing
# options are not enabled.
#
#KILL_HOSTS_DENY="ALL: $TARGET$"

# Format Two: New Style - The format used when extended option
# processing is enabled. You can drop in extended processing
# options, but be sure you escape all '%' symbols with a backslash
# to prevent problems writing out (i.e. \%c \%h )
#
KILL_HOSTS_DENY="ALL: $TARGET$ : DENY"

###################
# External Command#
###################
# This is a command that is run when a host connects, it can be whatever
# you want it to be (pager, etc.). This command is executed before the
# route is dropped or after depending on the KILL_RUN_CMD_FIRST option below
#
#
# I NEVER RECOMMEND YOU PUT IN RETALIATORY ACTIONS AGAINST THE HOST SCANNING
# YOU!
#
# TCP/IP is an *unauthenticated protocol* and people can make scans appear out
# of thin air. The only time it is reasonably safe (and I *never* think it is
# reasonable) to run reverse probe scripts is when using the "classic" -tcp mode.
# This mode requires a full connect and is very hard to spoof.
#
# The KILL_RUN_CMD_FIRST value should be set to "1" to force the command
# to run *before* the blocking occurs and should be set to "0" to make the
# command run *after* the blocking has occurred.
#
#KILL_RUN_CMD_FIRST = "0"
#
#
#KILL_RUN_CMD="/some/path/here/script $TARGET$ $PORT$ $MODE$"
# for examples see /usr/share/doc/portsentry/examples/
KILL_RUN_CMD="/sbin/iptables -I INPUT -s $TARGET$ -j LOG --log-level DEBUG --log-prefix '[Portsentry] Dropping '"


#####################
# Scan trigger value#
#####################
# Enter in the number of port connects you will allow before an
# alarm is given. The default is 0 which will react immediately.
# A value of 1 or 2 will reduce false alarms. Anything higher is
# probably not necessary. This value must always be specified, but
# generally can be left at 0.
#
# NOTE: If you are using the advanced detection option you need to
# be careful that you don't make a hair trigger situation. Because
# Advanced mode will react for *any* host connecting to a non-used
# port below your specified range, you have the opportunity to
# really break things. (i.e someone innocently tries to connect to
# you via SSL [TCP port 443] and you immediately block them). Some
# of you may even want this though. Just be careful.
