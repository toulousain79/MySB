To send mail from your script, you can use the following command:
	subject=\"MySB - NAS transfer finished !\"
	curl --data \"username=$UserName&get_custom1=$get_custom1&get_name=$get_name&subject=$subject\" http://localhost:8888/rTorrent.php

Scripts ending with the extension '.sh' will be performed at the end of a download.
They will be executed in alphabetical order.
The script 'synchro.sh.example' should be enough if you plan to synchronize with RSYNC (via SSH) or FTPs.

Set a list of categories (MySB Portal> MySB Options), then choose the appropriate synchronize mode.
For example:
	Linux		-->	Synchronization starts immediately after its download via rTorrent.
	Travail		--> The synchronization will be performed at the time you programmed.
	Autres		-->	No synchronization, the files remain on your server.

NOTES:
	1/	Consider adding your planning (MySB Portal> MySB Options), otherwise the relevant categories will never be synchronized...
	2/	Categories (subfolders) you add will also respected on the destination of the synchronization.
		This means that if you synchronize 'Linux\ubuntu.iso', it will be copied into 'Linux\ubuntu.iso'."
