# Warnings
## SWAP
* You must have a swap partition for systems with less than 2GB of RAM!
* Your swap partition should be at least equal to your RAM.

## Knowledge of Linux
* **DO NOT** all your usernames and password should be written **without** space.
* **DO NOT** upgrade anything in your box, ask in the thread **before** even thinking about it.
* **DO NOT** try to reconfigure packages using other tutorials or yourself.
* **TO UPGRADE** your system, please use **MySB_UpgradeSystem** command. _(This command is comparable to an APT update + APT upgrade)_

## OVH servers	_(OVH, KimSufi, SoYouStart)_
* Use the **default distribution kernel**. In your OVH manager interface, when you start the installation process, choose **Custom install**, and **Use of kernel distribution**.

* You can monitor your server, simply specify it during MySB installation. **BUT** I still advice to **disable** this service in the OVH interface. If you allow monitoring with MySB, the IPs of your provider will be **added** to the whitelist globally (PeerGuardian, Fail2Ban, IPTables), and those addresses will **not be filtered**. The system works on SoYouStart servers. But has **not been verified** on others OVH servers like KimSufi !

* If you leave the monitoring enable in the OVH interface **AND** you do not activated it during installation of MySB, your server may be **rebooted in rescue mode** by the OVH staff... If you want use the monitoring, you **must** first disable it **BEFORE** start the MySB installation. You can reactivate it **AFTER** the END of installation. You can also disable the Real Time Monitoring (RTM), read this page. [Real Time Monitoring (RTM)](http://www.torrent-invites.com/showthread.php?t=39022)
